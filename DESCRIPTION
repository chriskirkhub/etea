Title: This package enables the classification of unstructured textual data into
    a structured, segmented, temporal, document frequency matrix for use as input
    into predictive modelling systems such as neural networks or state-space models.

Description: In order to analyse events that involve human behaviour or the
    interactions between human and organisation in diverse fields such as in special
    investigations, clinical treatment systems or capital market transactions,
    investigators benefit from examination of the content of clinical, case or
    transaction notes and records. Examination typically comprises the application
    of methodologies such as feature-extraction, classification and 'sentiment'
    valence analysis. By pre-processing unstructured text into components that also
    group transitions together, the potential for added value derived from adaptive
    algorithms processing and post-processing can be leveraged significantly to
    provide a multi-dimensional classification of textual content over state or
    time. The majority of cases can be described using classification categories
    grouped into Environment, Thought, Emotion and Action, (etea) from which the
    title of this package has been derived. Notably, these groupings also promote
    temporal analysis. This package enables the classification of unstructured
    textual data into a structured, segmented, temporal frequency matrix for use
    as input into predictive modelling systems such as neural networks or state-
    space models. This package is expected to be of interest to all those who seek
    to enhance knowledge discovery and to model using unstructured text as the data
    source. Typical cases include: behavioural analysis and segmentation studies of
    markets; scoring of texts for sequencing models or signature channels; special
    interest groups and investigations: Families with Complex Needs; Special Victims
    Units and Victim Support; Clinical or Treatment Systems.
