Description: In order to investigate events that involve human behaviour or
    the interactions between human and organisation such as in clinical treatment
    systems or capital market transactions, investigators need to examine the
    content of clinical, case or transaction notes and records. Such examination
    is possible by the application of methodologies such as feature-extraction,
    classification and the so-called 'sentiment' valence analysis. These can
    quantify the attraction or aversion to an event or situation such as the study
    of the emotional content of documents. This package enables the classification
    of unstructured textual data into a structured, segmented, temporal frequency
    matrix for use as input into predictive modelling systems such as neural
    networks or state-space models.
