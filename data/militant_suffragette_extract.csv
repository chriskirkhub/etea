1;03/02/2009;1;1;As I was out shopping this morning I noticed on a poster outside a newsagent's shop  Suffragettes abandon Militant Tactics. I did not trouble to go in and buy a paper because I prefer to wait and see the truth on Friday. I do not think it is at all likely to be true anyhow as regards the next deputation the date of which has been fixed for on or about March 1st. I sincerely hope not for I have made all arrangements to enable me to spare a month for prison before going abroad. It is interesting to notice how public opinion alters on this Suffrage question as time goes on. First of all people said we went to prison because we were paid for it. Then when it was proved that that was not so they said we liked prison that it was only a luxurious detention and the notoriety made it worth while. That was what was being said when I joined the Movement.
2;03/02/2009;1;2;When the hunger strike first started everyone said that though one woman might be found to do such a thing the others would not follow her example. However they all did, not one failed. Then people began to say that Suffragettes behaved in a disorderly way and instead of submitting to the consequent imprisonment refused to eat in order to be released. One writer in the Westminster Gazette even described it as a simple device for escaping punishment! The fact that every one of these women had submitted to this punishment before some several times was overlooked as was also the  luxurious detention  argument and the weakness of the Home Secretary was commented on.
3;03/02/2009;1;3;I would like to invite the writer of that article to try the experiment of this  simple device  for six days and then to explain why if the prisoners wished to escape punishment they did not adopt the much simpler device of paying the fine. When the forcible reeding started everyone said :  Now this will soon stop these ridiculous women. Not many will be found ready to submit to all that it entails for more than a day or two if that. Nevertheless every one of them did though in at least one case it lasted for three months and on their release after they had been nursed back to some measure of health they professed themselves ready to go again. The latest thing I have heard said is that it is a species of insanity. If this be so the outlook for England is a serious one for not only is insanity enormously and rapidly increasing but it is spreading where it might least be expected to be found. 
4;29/03/2009;2;1;A funny thing happened to-day. A friend of mine who was very anxious to have her hand read by a palmist and had been strongly advised to visit a clairvoyant here who is said to be wonderful asked me if I would accompany her which I did as I was curious to hear what would be said. Then we reached the house however the woman refused to have us in the room together so finally we both had our fortunes told separately. It really was rather extraordinary for of course the clairvoyant had never seen me before and there is nothing about my appearance to suggest that I am a criminal.
5;29/03/2009;2;2;I was not even Wearing our colours and yet after looking into her crystal she said :  You will be in prison. I hurriedly explained that I contemplated going in a deputation to the Prime Minister and I presumed that would be the result. She gazed steadily into the crystal.  No she said slowly  it will be for something else later on.  Please do not infer I begged  that I shall be imprisoned for theft. The clairvoyant smiled.  No it is for some- thing in connection with this work. You will go in a very big deputation much larger than has ever gone before you will be roughly handled and will be in great danger from horses. You will be arrested but I do not think that you will go to prison this time.  That is impossible I interrupted.  Every- one that has been arrested has always been to prison. You surely do not mean that I would pay the fine    I cannot tell what will happen said the clairvoyant.  I can only tell you what I see. The Government will do something quite unexpected. Later on I see a great disappointment for you, also you might go in a still larger deputation next year. I see a flag which means triumph in the end but it will not be for some time yet. Of course she must be wrong but it is strange that she should have seen the deputation in the crystal. 
6;22/07/2009;3;1;My second speech really was a success  though I says it as shouldn't. I arrived at Mrs. W 's house to find a large Pages from Diary of a Militant Suffragette 91 drawing-room filled with ladies who were having tea as a preliminary entertainment. Of course I was wearing the colours and the badge. My hostess introduced me to the assembly as  the speaker who has just returned from London. It was decided that Mrs. W would take the chair and say a few words then I was to make a speech in defence of the methods after which questions could be asked by the audience. Six questions had already been written on pieces of paper by some of the ladies and placed on the table in readiness for me. I do not believe that a single woman in the room was really an  anti. They were principally people who knew little or nothing of the subject and a few who strongly disapproved of our methods as unwomanly having read and accepted the newspaper accounts.
7;22/07/2009;3;2;Anyhow by the time I had finished speaking I asked if any women who still felt that we had gone too far would hold up their hands and not one did.  I am glad to see I remarked  that no one here has any fault to find with the militant methods. Personally I have got one - that they are not militant enough. I then proceeded to read out and answer the written questions as follows : - I have kept the papers so as to remember.
8;22/07/2009;3;3;(1) Admitting as everyone must that many laws as they now stand are unfair to women why should you blame men ? I am sure they are just as anxious as we are that laws should be just. Answer. We do not blame men. Tout aucontraire. We blame the fact that men have to make laws referring to women and the home without any woman's point of view being represented.
9;22/07/2009;3;4;(2) As the laws which are unfair to women were made many years ago when social conditions were different is it not likely that any new ones will be made equally fair to both sexes without women having the vote ? Answer. Certainly not. John Burns has been trying to bring in a law to prevent married women from working the inevitable result of which if it passed would be that they and their children would starve. This law was to help the solution of the unemployment problem,  unemployed  being evidently a masculine term. I could quote several laws passed recently with the best intentions which are extremely unfair to women.
10;22/07/2009;3;5;(3) I have- met more women who were against Woman's Suffrage than men which proves that the majority do not want it. Answer. Of course men are less opposed to Woman's Suffrage than women because they understand political economy better and realise how vitally important the political vote is to any class or sex and how impossible it will be for women to better their conditions without it. If men had not realised this fact they would not have fought as they did to secure it for themselves. All the women who understand want it - the medical women the University women the working women.
11;22/07/2009;3;6;(4) If Adult Suffrage were to follow later would there not be a majority of almost a million women voters over men } Answer. Yes but women as a sex would never combine on any question. Why even this extremely personal question of votes for women has men in favour of it and women against it.
12;22/07/2009;3;7;(5) If women are not satisfied with man-made laws neither will they be satisfied with woman-made laws. Answer. Of course not. But who ever suggested having woman-made laws? That would be as ridiculous a mistake as the present arrangement. We want the use of a left hand as well as a right not instead of it.
13;22/07/2009;3;8;(6) Are not the militant methods retarding the movement and putting the hands of the clock back.' Answer. Militant methods have advanced the hands of the clock beyond the hopes of the most sanguine of the Suffragettes. Whoever heard of Votes for Women before the militant methods began although these same women had been agitating constitutionally for years.
14;22/07/2009;3;9;A movement that can raise 50000 and which can number thousands of members in a space of a few years is a progressive movement. After the questions had been answered we all discussed the question at great length and to my surprise I found no opposition at all. Many of the women said that they would certainly join the Union and all the literature I had brought with me was sold at once. 
15;24/09/2009;4;1;This morning I read in a comic paper an article entitled  When we are Suffragetted. It purported to be a letter written by a man to his wife after women had secured the vote. He complained of having to bath the baby and cook the dinner etc. while she spent her time at the polling booth or in Parliament. It is a strange thing that no one has ever depicted harassed wives of doctors having to prescribe for patients while their husbands vote or lawyers' wives preparing legal documents and interviewing clients in their husbands' absence at the polling booth. Evidently it is considered quite possible for a man to attend to his duties even though he be the breadwinner and at the same time possess a Parliamentary vote but in the case of women the exercise of the vote would occupy the whole of their lives to the detriment of all other duties. I should very much like to hear the reason of this explained for it is the commonest argument against Woman's Suffrage if the most futile.
16;24/09/2009;4;2;One never sells the papers without hearing the same thing over and over again.  Who will cook the dinner? Who will look after the baby.'' What about the washing?  One is compelled to wonder whether there is such a thing as family life and homes in Australia. Another point which these critics seem to entirely overlook is that so far as the law is concerned the home is the one place where a woman has no power at all - less in fact than anywhere else.  The husband has the power to select where the home shall be and how it shall be conducted. In the eyes of the law he is the sole parent of the child so long as he is alive and the decision as to the child's upbringing rests entirely with him. Whether the husband be good or bad the wife is by law entirely subservient to him. She has no legal right to any share of the husband's income except in the case of actual desertion, and if while continuing to live with her he refuses to pay her a single penny of his wages she cannot obtain such payment except by breaking up her home and going into the workhouse. Short of this she and her children can starve and yet she cannot claim the protection of the law to obtain maintenance from her husband.
17;24/09/2009;4;3;Finally in the event of either party to the marriage being guilty of definite immorality there is a total difference in the treatment accorded to husband and wife. The fact that the majority of men live above the law and do not take advantage of this state of affairs does not make the legislation any fairer and it seems reasonable to me that if a woman is to look upon marriage as her real raison d'etre she should be accorded some rights in her sole legitimate sphere the home. 
18;28/01/2010;5;1;In the Votes for Women paper to-day there is a letter by Lady Constance describing her experiences in prison. She had disguised herself as a working woman and taken the name of Jane Warton in order to escape the  special treatment  accorded her on both previous occasions by Herbert Gladstone on account of her rank. The result was that they did not take the trouble to examine her heart before letting her undergo the ordeal of forcible feeding. It is interesting in this connection to read in the  Memoirs of Prince Kropotkin  the following extracts : -  The horror of such (hunger) strikes seemed not to appeal to the gendarmes. At Karkoff the prostrated prisoners were tied up with ropes and artificially fed. The result of this treatment was that the Governor General Kropotkin was shot dead. The central prison at which the first hunger strike and consequent artificial feeding took place was under his orders. Further on in the book Prince Kropotkin says that  no Englishman would have tolerated this brutal treatment of prisoners.
19;28/01/2010;5;2;As I read Lady Constance's letter and remembered the writer as I saw her the other day in Edinburgh a new sense of the wonderful love that this Movement has created in women came to me. She describes herself as physically a coward. I feel that I cannot better express my view of her conduct than by quoting as follows from what Mrs. Pethick Lawrence has written about her in to-day's paper.  Lady Constance Lytton was not thinking of Mr. Gladstone when she planned the conditions of her arrest and imprisonment. She was thinking of Selina Martin of Mrs. Leigh of many other women who have endured direr and more long-drawn-out suffering than that even which she was called upon eventually to endure. She was thinking of great wrongs that are done in our police courts in the name of justice. She endured imprisonment insult and torture that she might hasten the day when the dark stain of our present prison system should be wiped out of a cleaner civilisation. She wrote upon the wall of her prison cell the words of Thoreau :  Under a Government that imprisons any unjustly the true place for a just man (or woman) is also in prison.
20;28/01/2010;5;3;The action of Lady Constance Lytton has a political bearing. It is a startling and significant event in the Movement for the emancipation of women. But it has very much more than a political significance. It has a profound human and moral significance. It is an action that will not be forgotten. Some day not just now but before very long the world will understand it and then it will be written in letters of gold upon the tablets of human history. In years to come this story of compassion and chivalry will be told in the schools to children yet unborn. And they will listen to it as we listened when we were children to the tale of the chivalrous knight Sir Philip Sydney when self- oblivious he passed the cup of water that had been raised to his lips to the dying soldier in the field with the words :  His need is greater than mine. And many a woman child will say in her heart : 
21;28/01/2010;5;4;I too will be fearless and chivalrous and brave. As for Herbert Gladstone and the part he has played from the commencement in connection with this Movement the sense of burning anger I used to have has gone and my feeling for him is one of deep pity. Degrading and horrible as prison experience must necessarily be for any woman who enters the fighting line now I would rather experience it not only once but half a dozen times than be in the position of the Home Secretary to-day.
