Date,Notes
10/08/1888 ,An inquest was opened yesterday in Whitechapel on the body of a woman who was found dead at George Yard early on Tuesday morning. There were thirty nine punctured wounds on the body. There appeared to be some doubt about the identity of the deceased. The inquiry was adjourned. Yesterday Mr. George Collier the deputy coroner for South East Middlesex opened an inquiry at the Working Lads' Institute Whitechapel on the body of Martha Turner (Tabram) aged 35 a single woman lately living at 4 Star place Commercial road who was found lying on the landing of George yard buildings on Tuesday morning last with more than 20 stab wounds about her person as already reported. Previous to calling the first witness the Coroner said that the body had been identified that morning but he had just been informed that two other persons also identified it as quite a different person and under those circumstances he thought the question of identity had better be left till the last. Elizabeth Mahony of 47 George yard buildings Whitechapel the wife of a car-man stated that on the night of Bank Holiday she was out with some friends. She returned shortly before two in the morning with her husband and afterwards left the house to try and get some supper. The stairs were then perfectly clear of any obstacle and were the same on her return. She and her husband heard no noise during the night but at ten o'clock she was told that a murder had been committed in the building. There was no light on the staircase. The spot where the body was found had been pointed out to her. She was sure it was not there at two o'clock as she went in as it was in the wide part of the stairs and quite in the dark. Alfred George Crow a cabdriver of 35 George yard buildings deposed that on Tuesday morning he returned home from work at half past three. On his way up the stairs he saw somebody lying on the first landing. It was not an unusual thing to see so he passed on and went to bed. He did not know whether the person was dead or alive when he passed. John Saunders Reeves 37 George yard buildings a waterside labourer deposed that on Tuesday morning he left home at five o'clock to go in search of work. On the first floor landing he saw a woman lying in a pool of blood. She lay on her back and seemed dead. He at once gave notice to the police. She was a stranger. Her clothes were all disarranged as if she had had a struggle with someone. The witness did not notice any instrument lying about. Dr. Timothy Robert Kelleene 28 Brick lane stated that he was called to the deceased and found her dead. He examined the body and found 39 punctured wounds. There were no fewer than nine in the throat and 17 in the breast. She appeared to have been dead three hours. the body was well nourished. He had since made a post mortem examination and found the left lung penetrated in two places and the right lung in two places. The heart had been penetrated but only in one place otherwise it was quite healthy. The liver was healthy but penetrated in five places and the spleen was penetrated in two places. The stomach was penetrated in six places. In the witness's opinion the wounds were not inflicted with the same instrument there being a deep wound in the breast from some long strong instrument while most of the others were done apparently with a penknife. The large wound could have been caused by a sword bayonet or dagger. It was impossible for the whole of the wounds to be self inflicted. Death was due to loss of blood consequent on the injuries. At the conclusion of this witness's evidence the inquiry was adjourned. 
01/09/1888,"A shocking murder was discovered in Whitechapel yesterday morning. Shortly before four o'clock Police constable Neil found a woman lying in Buck's row Thomas Street with her throat cut from ear to ear. The body which was immediately removed to a mortuary was also fearfully mutilated. The deceased has been identified as Mary Ann Nicholls thirty six years of age who was recently an inmate of Lambeth Workhouse. No clue to the murderer has however yet been obtained. A murder of the most brutal kind was committed in the neighbourhood of Whitechapel in the early hours of yesterday morning but by whom and with what motive is at present a complete mystery. At a quarter to four o'clock Police constable Neill 97 J when in Buck's row Whitechapel came upon the body of a woman lying on a part of the footway and on stooping to raise her up in the belief that she was intoxicated he discovered that her throat was cut almost from ear to ear. Assistance was procured a messenger being sent at once to the station and for a doctor. Dr. Llewellyn of Whitechapel road whose surgery is not more than 300 yards from the spot where the woman lay was aroused and proceeded at once to the scene. He hastily inspected the body where it lay and pronounced the woman dead. The police ambulance from the Bethnal Green station having arrived the body was removed there. A further examination showed the horrible nature of the crime for the lower part of the woman's body was found to have been horrible mutilated by three or four deep gashes. Any one of the wounds was sufficient to cause death. After the body was removed to the mortuary of the parish in Old Montague Street Whitechapel steps were taken to secure if possible identification but at first with little prospect of success. The clothing on the body was of a common description. It was discovered that the skirt of one petticoat and the band of another article bore the stencil stamp of Lambeth Workhouse. The only articles in the pockets were a comb and a piece of looking glass. The latter led the police to conclude that the murdered was an inhabitant of one of the numerous lodging houses in the neighbourhood. As the news of the murder spread one woman and then another came forward to view the body and at length it was found that a woman answering the description of the deceased had lived in a common lodging house in Thrawl Street Spitalfields. Women from that place were fetched and they identified the deceased as ""Polly"" who had shared a room with three other women in the place on the usual terms of such houses - nightly payment of 4d each each woman having a separate bed. She had frequented the place for about three weeks past. When she presented herself for her lodging on Thursday night she was turned away because she had not the money. She was then the worse for liquor. A woman of the neighbourhood saw her later she told the police - even as late as 2.30 on Friday morning - in Whitechapel road opposite the Church and at the corner of Osborn Street and at a quarter to four she was found within 500 yards of the spot murdered. At about half past seven last evening a woman named Mary Anne Monk at present an inmate of Lambeth Workhouse was taken to the mortuary and identified the body as that of Mary Ann Nicholls. She was with her in the Lambeth Workhouse in April and May last. On the 12th of May Nicholls left the workhouse to take a situation as servant at Wandsworth common. Her stay there however was short. From that time she had been wandering about. She was a married woman but had been living apart from her husband for some years. Her age was 36 and had been an inmate of Lambeth Workhouse off and on for the past seven years. She was first admitted to the workhouse seven years ago and from this point seems to have entered upon a downward career. The matter is being investigated by Detective Inspector Abberline of Scotland yard and Inspector Helson J Division. The latter states that he walked carefully over the ground soon after 8 o'clock in the morning and beyond the discolourations ordinarily found on pavements there was no sign of stains. Viewing the spot where the body was found however it seems difficult to believe that the woman received her death wounds there. The body must have been nearly drained of blood but that found in Buck's row was small indeed. The police have no theory with respect to the matter except that a sort of ""High Rip"" gang exists in the neighbourhood which ""blackmailing"" women who frequent the Streets takes vengeance on those who do not find money for them. They base that surmise on the fact that within twelve months two other women have been murdered in the district by almost similar means - one as recently as the 6th of August last - and left in the gutter of the Street in the early hours of the morning. The other theory is that the woman whilst undressed was murdered in a house near her clothes being then huddled on the body which was afterwards conveyed out to be deposited in the Street. Colour is lent to this by the small quantity comparatively of blood found on the clothes and by the fact that the clothes are not cut. If the woman was murdered on the spot where the body was found it is almost impossible to believe that she would not have aroused the neighbourhood by her screams Buck's row being a Street tenanted all down one side by a respectable class of people superior to many of the surrounding Streets the other side being a blank wall bounding a warehouse. Dr. Llewellyn yesterday made the following statement:- I was called to Buck's row about five minutes to four this morning by Police constable Thane (sic) who said a woman had been murdered. I went to the place at once and found deceased lying on the ground in front of the stableyard door. She was lying on her back with her legs out straight as though she had been laid down. Police constable Neil told me that the body had not been touched. The throat was cut from ear to ear and the woman was quite dead. On feeling the extremities of the body I found that they were still warm showing that death had not long ensued. A crowd was now gathering and as it was undesirable to make a further examination in the Street I ordered the removal of the body to the mortuary telling the police to send for me again if anything of importance transpired. There was a very small pool of blood in the pathway which had trickled from the wound in the throat not more than would fill two wine glasses or half a pint at the outside. This fact and the way which the deceased was lying made me think at the time that it was probable that the murder was committed elsewhere and the body conveyed to Buck's row. At the time I had no idea of the fearful abdominal wounds which had been inflicted upon the body. At half past five I was summoned to the mortuary by the police and was astonished at finding the other wounds. I have seen many horrible cases but never such a brutal affair as this. From the nature of the cuts on the throat it is probable that they were inflicted with the left hand. There is mark at the point of the jaw on the right side of the deceased's face as though made by a person's thumb and a similar bruise on the left side as if the woman's head had been pushed back and her throat then cut. There is a gash under the left ear reaching nearly to the centre of the throat and another cut apparently starting from the right ear. The neck is severed back to the vertebrae which is also slightly injured. The abdominal wound are extraordinary for their length and the severity with which they have been inflicted. Deceased's clothes were loose and the wounds could have been inflicted while she was dressed."" The inquest will be held by Mr. Wynne E. Baxter the coroner for the district at the Working Lads' Institute Whitechapel at one o'clock today. "
10/09/1888,"Another shocking murder with still more atrocious mutilation of the victim than in the previous case was perpetrated between five and six o'clock in Saturday morning in Whitechapel. The scene of this crime was the yard of 29 Hanbury Street and the murdered person Annie Chapman was again a woman of low life and in the poorest circumstances. No clue to the murderer had up to last night been obtained. These repeated murders in the Whitechapel district have produced an amount of alarm and anxiety in that neighbourhood bordering on panic. The inquest will be opened today when evidence of the finding of the body and of the mutilations will be given. On Saturday one more crime was added to the ghastly series of Whitechapel murders. Just before six that morning a woman was found murdered and mutilated at a lodging house in Hanbury Street Whitechapel road. She was of the same class as Mary Ann Nicholls and she was butchered in much the same way. If there was a difference it was in favour of the earlier victim. The head of Annie Chapman the latest had been nearly severed from her body by one stroke of a sharp knife and her mangled remains had been disposed about her in a way that suggested a delight in the slaughter for the slaughter's sake. The details for those who are able to endure the recital of them will be found elsewhere. The house in Hanbury Street is open all night. People are coming and going at all hours mostly if not wholly on perfectly lawful business as many of them are labourers and market people. The body was found in the back yard. At twenty minutes past five a lodger went into the yard and noticed nothing to excite his suspicion. At a few minutes to six another lodger went there and saw a sight that sent him screaming through the house. All then had been done in half an hour. In that time the murderer had decoyed the woman into the house slain her in the yard robbed her of her sham rings inflicted nameless indignities on the dead body indignity upon indignity horror upon horror and got clean away. The house teemed with life; it was near the hour of rising for most of the inmates yet no human being heard a cry or an alarm. The swiftness of it the perfect mystery of it are heightening effects of terror. The wildest imagination has never combined in fiction so many daring improbabilities as have here been accomplished in fact. It is a positive relief to escape from the fact to the theory of the crime. There can no longer be any doubt that we have to deal with some form of malignant insanity. No person could murder at these risks and for these gains with any sense of purpose in his acts as purpose is known to the sane. A monster is abroad. The murders defy all rules of motive; they only suggest a union not at all uncommon in insanity of the utter absence of a moral sense with the most finished cunning in the adaptation of means to ends. Both are abnormal - the cunning and the worse than tigerish passion for blood. The first is quite as remarkable as the last and its very perfection suggests a mind completely off its balance - that is quite undeveloped on one side. The dreadful surety of the stroke would have been impossible to any being of ordinary mould. Every cut must have been given with the unerring precision of the slaughterhouse. One stroke took the head from the body the others went straight to the mark of that elaborate desecration with which the crime was brought to a close. There was no more waste of effort than there is in the killing of a sheep. There could have been no more pity or anger or violent passion of any sort. The police have to find for us one of the most extraordinary monsters known to the history of mental and spiritual disease a monster whose skull will have to be cast for all the surgical museums of the world. No other theory is admissible. Who could have done such things for gain alone or in the prosecution of any definite scheme of revenge? No ""blackmailer"" of unfortunate women would ever cut himself off from his market in this way. The thief never deals a useless stroke. The public are looking for a monster and in the legend of ""Leather Apron"" the Whitechapel part of them seem to be inventing a monster to look for. This kind of invention ought to be discouraged in every possible way or there may soon be murders from panic to add to murders from lust of blood. A touch would fire the whole district in the mood which it is now. Leather Apron walks without making a noise Leather Apron has piercing eyes and a strange smile and finally Leather Apron looks like a Jew. The last is brutal as well as foolish and it has already had its effect in a cry against Whitechapel Jews. Already as our columns show today the list of savage assaults in the neighbourhood has shown an alarming increase since the discovery on Saturday. Every man who can say a reasonable word ought to say it or worse may follow than all we have already known. Much depends on the police. It is hardly too much to say that the peace of a whole quarter of London is now in an especial manner in their hands. We have already commented on the inadequacy of the Force in the district affected by these crimes. Hanbury Street must have been poorly patrolled if so much could have passed there in half an hour and have left no trace behind. The police have a good deal of lost ground to recover. In the past year or two they have failed to bring many terrible offenders to justice. The Kentish town murder is still one of the mysteries of crime and so is the murder at Canonbury. A lady was murdered near Bloomsbury square last year - the murderer has not been found. At about the same time a solicitor's clerk was murdered in Arthur Street with precisely the same result. It is certain that no effort will be spared; but the public will hardly be satisfied with an assurance of that sort. The police must somehow contrive to win this time. Whatever the event the crimes must remain a kind of public disgrace. It is sickening to think of the way some of us live now as revealed in the incidental particulars of this tragedy. It is difficult to believe that no sound was heard at the critical moment. Sounds pass unheeded in Hanbury Street - that is all. The lodger who came down at 5.25 fancied he hard a slight scuffle with the noise of someone falling against the pailings but he took no notice of that. They take very little notice in Hanbury Street even of strangers to the house who sometimes turn in for a sleep on the stairs before the markets open. The murdered woman used to sleep in a lodging house in Dorset Street when she had the money. When she had not she went out to earn it. She had come out on a quest of this sort the night of the murder. It was not her only vicissitude that week. At the beginning of it she had been rather severely knocked about by another woman in a stand up fight. She had thought of taking a turn at hop picking if she could get a pair of boots. A few hours after her body had been discovered another of her sex was nearly murdered in Spitalfields Market. But there was mystery in this affair. It was only a blind man quarrelling with the woman who served as his guide - wrangling as he walked along and stabbing as he wrangled. So tens of thousands of us live now in the greatest capital of the world. "
01/10/1888,"Two dreadful murders were committed yesterday morning in or near the East-end. In one case a woman was found in a yard in Berner-Street Commercial-road with her head nearly severed from her body. In the other case a woman was found in Mitre-square Aldgate (Catherine Eddowes) within the City jurisdiction with her throat cut from ear to ear and the body mutilated in a way that reproduced the worst features of the murder of Annie Chapman. Both the victims were women of low life. The body found in Berner-Street has been identified as that of Elizabeth Stride. Late last night a man was arrested on suspicion at a lodging-house in the Borough. If it were worthwhile to form any new theory of the East-end murders-as assuredly it is not-a new one would be wanted for the fresh horrors of yesterday morning. All theories seem beside the question in what must for the present be the almost distracted state of the public mind. There is nothing to say but that between one and two on Sunday morning two more horrible butcheries were added to the swelling list of the East-end crimes. The particulars of the past tragedies of this series would serve almost exactly for the new ones. The victims were two night wanderers and one of them is known to have been of a certain class. Both were killed in precisely the same way as MARY ANNE NICHOLLS and ANNIE CHAPMAN and one was mutilated like the last named. If there were a printed form for the description of such atrocities it would only require a few entries of names and dates to make one account serve for all. Each of those butchered on Sunday morning might have been twin sister to CHAPMAN or NICHOLLS. The only way in which the murderer-if as seems likely these crimes are to be attributed to one hand-seems now to differ from himself is that he grows bolder by impunity. One victim for one night was his former rule. He now with unerring precision cuts off two within an hour. No more time was required than might have enabled him to pass from Berner-Street Commercial-road the scene of the first murder to Mitre-square the scene of the second and to complete the indispensable preliminaries of each deed of horror. These included the ""picking up"" of the women and the luring them to a quiet spot which for a few brief minutes might serve as his temporary slaughter-house. At about one a man driving into a yard in Berner-Street nearly ran over the body of a woman with her head almost severed from her body. At about two a policeman passing through Mitre-square where he is said to have passed but a few minutes before without seeing anything to excite suspicion nearly fell over the body of another woman. In the brief interval between his first and second round this woman had been murdered exactly as ANNIE CHAPMAN was murdered mutilated in the same way and beside that gashed fearfully about the face as though in a desperate struggle to prevent her from raising an alarm. No more is known and as things seem to be going now perhaps no more ever will be known. In the accounts which we publish to-day there is indeed some mention of a man said to have been seen in the company of one of the deceased women and the description of him tallies in some degree with that of the mysterious companion of CHAPMAN. The latter was described as dark over forty not tall of shabby genteel appearance and dressed in a deerstalker hat and a dark coat. The man said to have been seen on Sunday morning was dark aged about twenty-eight and about five feet eight inches in height. He was of respectable appearance and he wore a black diagonal coat and a hard felt hat. If we are to regard him as the murderer his proceedings of Sunday morning seem to confound every possible speculation as to the manner of the crimes. To reach Mitre-square from Berner-Street he must have hurried dripping with blood through Streets still not entirely deserted in spite of the hour. He must have been literally drenched with blood after the completion of the second crime yet he passed on unchallenged and unmolested until he reached his lair. To add to these risks of detection he had to accost the second woman and to win her confidence while he was still fresh from the butchery of the first. Never was there a greater mystery of crime. Yet in this state he was observed by no one and especially by no member of that Force which is supposed to have eyes for a sleeping world. It is impossible to avoid the depressing conviction that the Police are about to fail once more as they have failed with CHAPMAN as they have failed with NICHOLLS as they have failed with TABRAM as they have failed with SMITH (Emma Smiths death was not attributed to JtR.) as they are failing with the unknown victim whose limbs apparently are being scattered broadcast over the metropolis from Pimlico to Newington. The Police have done nothing they have thought of nothing and in their detective capacity they have shown themselves distinctly inferior to the bloodhounds which a few years ago in the provinces tracked the mysterious murderer of a little girl to his doom. The trail must run true and clear from Berner-Street to Mitre-square and beyond for those who have the true instinct of the detective calling. None of the accepted apologies for the shortcomings of the force will cover their repeated failure in these extraordinary cases. The inadequacy of their numbers though it is absolute in regard to the Metropolitan district taken as a whole is but relative in regard to the limited area which is the scene of these crimes. A very slight reinforcement would serve to bring it to almost any strength that might be desired at the point of contact. The worse murder moreover the one which with its ghastly sequel must have taken the more time occurs in that municipal district where many hundreds of men patrol the one square mile by night to the average of two men for each of the 688 square miles of ""Metropolitan"" area around it. As we showed some time since on the authority of the annual Report of the Chief Commissioner the Metropolitan Force is ludicrously small. It has no grip of London. Its expansion has not kept pace with the expansion of the capital. It undertakes to patrol a district inhabited by over five and a quarter millions of people with an available force allowing for deductions for stationary duty of less than 8000 men and with but sixty per cent. of these on duty between ten at night and six in the morning. In the quarter of these crimes apparently whatever changes there may have been in the frequency there has been no change in the manner of the patrol. There has been no sudden doubling on the beat to baffle the calculations of the murderer. The policeman tramps slowly by as he tramped before and to those who have an interest in the calculation his returning tread may be timed with the same certainty as the movements of a planetary body. The entire management of this business on the part of the representatives of law and order exhibits what under the circumstances may justly be called an appalling lack of resource. There has been no sign of an especial cunning of device to meet the terrible emergencies of the case. There has been no hearty co-operation with the Press which on a hundred occasions has saved the Detective Department from the worst consequences of its own mistakes. There must be something incurably faulty in the organization and management of the Force and to all appearance the gallant soldier who is at the head of it will never be able to tell us what it is. The public are fast coming to the belief that it is its military organization and the absence of local interest and control which makes our Metropolitan Police so inefficient in the very first of their duties-that of preventing violence and crime. The most agonizing of the East-end mysteries is the mystery of the utter paralysis of energy and intelligence on the part of the Police. "
10/11/1888,"Whitechapel has on horror's head horrors accumulated. Another woman Mary Jean Kelly has been murdered and mangled within a stone's throw of the places where women were murdered and mangled on the 7th of August the 31st of August the 8th of September and not far from the scene of either of the murders and mutilations of September the 30th. This latest murder far surpasses in hideous brutality any of the crimes which went before it. The mutilations are more wild and wanton and ghastly. The murderer whoever he may be would seem to have taken a positive delight in cutting and carving at the body of his victim. But although there was more hewing and hacking than in any of the former murders yet it is almost indisputably evident that this latest crime belongs to the same class as the crimes which went before it. The same kind of mutilation which put the trade mark of the assassin on other corpses is shown in the body of the young woman who was murdered yesterday. Of course we do not suggest that this is any conclusive evidence that this murder was done by the hand which may have committed some or all of the other crimes. There is a ghastly imitativeness in crime a horrible ""fashion"" which may be set going in murder and which reveals itself with the mechanical servility of any other imitativeness and any other fashion. A brutal man getting into a furious quarrel with a woman in some wretched slum of the East end might have been content a few months ago with kicking her to death or cutting her throat. Now however when such a man has quarrelled with a woman and killed her it is quite possible that he will not be satisfied until he has followed the new Whitechapel mode and gashed and disembowelled her. Therefore it is not to be hastily assumed that all the murders were done by the one hand or that the last murder was the work of the same criminal as any of the former. What we are fairly warranted in believing is that it is a crime which comes of the same impulse; which would not have been committed in such a way of the preceding crimes had not given it inspiration. The natural inclination of everybody would be to hope that the murders and the mutilations are the work of some solitary wretch with a positive mania for women's blood. It would be better that such were the explanation than to have to believe that one murderer hacked a woman to pieces and that several other murderers followed and improved upon his example. Nothing certainly in the history of crime has ever happened in this country which could be compared in horror and hideousness with this succession of Whitechapel slaughters. It is well to trace back this recent history of crime in the East end. It began last Christmas week when a woman was found bleeding and mangled in one of the poorest Streets of Whitechapel. She was barbarously wounded and in a manner somewhat like that which has characterised all the subsequent murders. She lived if we are not mistaken long enough to say that the crime was the work of several men. No trace of any criminal was found. The murder did not attract much attention at the time. Its very hideousness prevented the publication of full details and the ordinary reader of newspapers learned little more than the fact that a woman had been killed somewhere down Whitechapel way. Unhappily such an event as that is not so uncommon as to startle London from its propriety; and although if the whole story had been told the public might have been stirred up to serious alarm at the condition of things in the East end yet as the whole story was not told it was not generally supposed that any novelty in crime had been started. About Easter time another murder was committed in the same region which appeared to belong to the newly invented order of assassination. Early in August a woman was found dead on the landing of some model dwellings known as George yard Buildings Spitalfields. This poor creature was found to have been pierced with no less than thirty nine wounds most of which were in and about the abdomen. There were in this case evidences of deliberation very much like in some respects to those which presented themselves in more recent instances. Then came the murder of August 31; the murder of September 7th a mere duplicate of the preceding crime; and then followed quickly the two slaughter deeds of September 30. One of the victims of September 30 had been dealt with by the murderer after the fashion of the earlier sufferers. In the case of the other woman the work of mutilation had been begun but not finished. In the murder of yesterday the mutilating business was carried farther and to all appearance done more deliberately than in any former instance. In most in nearly all of these crimes we see certain common features. The woman is killed in the first instance by the cutting of her throat. She has no time to resist or even to scream. Then the assassin has her to use a famous phrase employed for quite a different purpose ""like a corpse on the dissecting table"" and he gashes her body at his deliberate pleasure. The first of the crimes we have mentioned would appear from the woman's own account to have been the work of several men. With regard to all the others such evidence as can be collected or the fact that little or no evidence of any kind can be got at would seem to show that in each case not more than one criminal could probably have been engaged. Five of the murders including that of yesterday may be generally described as belonging to just the same order; the same way of killing first; the same sort of deliberate mutilation afterwards; only that in yesterday's crime as we have said the hideous completeness of the work surpassed all preceding attempts. We have then the grim fact to face that within eight weeks five women have been murdered in the same way and mangled in the same way within a small area of the East end of London. The attention of the police authorities has been directed to that limited area for weeks and weeks back. The whole neighbourhood has been thrown into alarm and consternation. Every man and woman in the entire region must have been aroused to watchfulness and to activity. Yet the murders have been going on just the same - and we do not hear of any clue to the perpetrator of the latest many more than to the perpetrator of the earliest. If we are to accept what is certainly the general opinion that the last five murders at least are the work of one hand then the wonder becomes all the greater that one man can keep on doing such things deed after deed without being discovered. That such a man should again and again succeed in entrapping a woman into some lonely place and there slaughter her and yet never be seen never be noticed never be suspected by any one because of blood marks on his hands or his clothes would certainly seem to border on the miraculous. Of course there is the other possibility to which we have already drawn attention that some at least of the later crimes may have been the mere outcome of man's perverted imitativeness. The newspapers have been full of cases of men who threatened their wives or their sweethearts or women who were neither wives nor sweethearts that they would treat them in the Whitechapel way. Only yesterday or the day before there was reported the case of a man who declared that he was willing to give ten shillings to anyone who would rid him of his wife by the Whitechapel process. Practical jokers in the East end have frightened woken almost out of their senses by brandishing knives and proclaiming themselves to be Jack the Ripper. One such frolic actually caused a poor nervous woman to lose her life. While a mania of this kind is in the air we may expect to find mimicry take the form of earnest as well as of jest. But however the crimes are wrought the fact remains that while the police and public terribly forewarned are on the lookout for one particular sort of crime in one particular locality the crime goes on all the same and the criminal withdraws himself form all eyes as securely as though he possessed the charm which could make him invisible at will.
