# etea
etea (Environment/Thoughts/Emotions/Actions) is an 'R' package that contains functions to classify text into predetermined baskets as a conduit to matrix that can be used as an input into predictive or other analytical modules.  This work extends a methodology and code that is to be attributed to Dr Tim Jurka (timjurka/sentiment).
