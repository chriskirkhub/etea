# etea
etea (Environment/Thoughts/Emotions/Actions) is an 'R' package that contains functions to classify unstructured text into predefined baskets based on a lexicon of words and categories.  It is expected that this package will be of interest to those pre-processing text prior to further analysis such as augmentation through neural networks, decision systems or state-space modelling.

This 'R' package is expected to be of interest to all those who seek to enhance knowledge discovery and to model using unstructured text as the data source.

Typical cases include:
  behavioural analysis and segmentation studies of markets,
  scoring of texts for sequencing models or signature channels
  special interest groups and investigations:
    Families with Complex Needs,
    Special Victims Units and Victim Support,
    Clinical or Treatment Systems
