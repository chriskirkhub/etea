# etea
etea (Environment/Thoughts/Emotions/Actions) is an 'R' package that contains functions to classify unstructured text into predefined baskets based on a lexicon of words and categories.  It is expected that this package will be of interest to those pre-processing text prior to further analysis such as augmentation through neural networks, decision systems or state-space modelling.
